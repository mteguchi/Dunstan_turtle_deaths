# JAGS model for imputing missing hatchling counts at Raine Island

# The known cyclical nature of hatching is modeled by the discrete 
# Fourier series of one period per year.  Hatchling production starts
# December 20 and ends April 30 each season.  Observed counts are 
# limited so they are used to determine amplitude of each season
# and for each sector.  Amplitudes for sectors are correlated.

# First, tried with mvnorm but jags does not allow partially missing observations
# in mvnorm. So, changing it to five separate normals but a common slope
# parameter
