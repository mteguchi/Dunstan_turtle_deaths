# JAGS model for imputing missing turtle deaths at Raine Island

# The known cyclical nature of deaths is modeled by the discrete 
# Fourier series of one period per year.  Hatchling production starts
# October 15 and ends April 30 each season.  Observed counts are 
# limited so they are used to determine amplitude of each season
# and for each sector.  Amplitudes for sectors are correlated.
