## Introduction

Determining the number of deaths of green turtles at Raine Island is important in understanding the effects of these deaths on the population, as well as for investing in measures to decrease the deaths. In this document, I used data on observed deaths from periodical surveys of the island to estimate the total deaths for each nesting season. 

## Methods

```{r get.data, echo=F, include=F, cache=T}
Day.begin <- "10-15"
Day.end <- "04-30"

data.1 <- read_csv(file = "data/Turtle_deaths_with_zeros.csv",
                   col_types = cols(Date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%Y"),
                                    Heat = col_integer(),
                                    Cliff = col_integer(),
                                    Total = col_integer())) %>%
  mutate(Year = year(Date),
         DOY = yday(Date),
         Season = ifelse(Date >= paste0(Year, "-", Day.end), 
                         Year, Year-1),
         Season.f = as.factor(Season), 
         DOS = as.numeric(Date - as.Date(paste0(Season, "-", Day.begin)))) %>%  
  group_by(Season.f) %>%
  mutate(Cum_Heat = cumsum(Heat),
         Cum_Cliff = cumsum(Cliff))

# # find the number of days between Day1 and Day2
# n.days <- as.numeric(as.Date(paste0("2018-", Day.end)) - as.Date(paste0("2017-", Day.begin)))

seasons <- unique(data.1$Season)

n.seasons <- length(unique(data.1$Season))

max.days <- data.1 %>% 
  group_by(Season.f) %>% 
  summarise(total.days = max(DOS),
            n.days = n()) 

# data.2 has estimated total abundance on the island
data.2 <- read_csv(file = "data/Nhat_Drone.csv",
                   col_types = cols(Season = col_integer(),
                                    N_surveys = col_integer(),
                                    PI = col_double(),
                                    SE = col_double(),
                                    Mean_Tally = col_double()))
```

The dataset for this analysis contained the observed deaths of female green turtles at Raine Island from the 1995 to 2019 season. The dataset included presumed zeros at the beginning (October 15 - October 20) and end of each nesting season (April 1 - April 5). Observations were made only when a research team was present on the island. The number of trips per season varied over the years (Figure 1). Cause of deaths were grouped into either "heat-related" or "cliff-fall."  

```{r plot_observed, cache=T, include=F, echo=F}
data.1 %>% ungroup() %>%
  select(Date, Heat, Cliff) %>%
  gather(cause, count, Heat, Cliff) -> data.1.2

p.obsd <- ggplot(data = data.1.2) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Date, y = count, color = cause),
             alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_path(aes(x = Date, y = count, color = cause),
            alpha = 0.6) +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.position = c(0.8, 0.7)) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Cliff" = "blue",
                                "Heat" = "red")) + 
  labs(title = "Heat and Cliff fall", y = "Observed deaths") 

#p.obsd

if (save.fig)
  ggsave(plot = p.obsd,
         filename = "figures/observed_deaths.png", 
         device = "png",
         dpi = 600)


```


```{r plot_obsd, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, fig.cap = "Figure 1. Observed deaths of green turtle females from heat-related and cliff-fall causes at Raine Island."}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0("figures/observed_deaths.png"))
```

In order to estimate the number of unobserved deaths from the two causes (i.e., heat-related or cliff-fall), I fitted parametric functions to the data within each season using the state-space approach. The state space is modeled by modified versions of Richards function, whereas the observations are assumed to have either normal or Poisson distribution around the function. Modification of the Richards function represent varying assumptions of the underlying process. In total, ```r length(model.setting.list$model.names)``` models were constructed. The base function has the following form (Girondot et al. 2007).

M1 = (1 + (2 * exp(K) - 1) * exp((1/S1) * (P - d))) ^ (-1/exp(K))

M2 = (1 + (2 * exp(K) - 1) * exp((1/S) * (P - d))) ^ (-1/exp(K))

N = min + (max - min) * (M1 * M2)

S1 = -S

d = the number of days from the beginning of nesting season

S > 0 defines the "fatness" of the function

K > 0 defines the "flatness" at the peak of the function

P defines where the peak is relative to the range of d min(d) < P < max(d).

min = 0.

max = the maximum number of deaths per day.

Model names were abbreviated to indicate which parameters were estimated and what distributions were used as the observation model. I also developed a series normal-observation models where observation variance changed over time (sigmaYt). Varying K by season resulted in non-convergence. Consequently, time dependent K models were not considered. 
No correlation was found between the numbers of heat-related and cliff-fall deaths. Consequently, these data were modeled separately. 

Model parameters were estimated via the Bayesian approach using JAGS (v.4.3.0) with the jagsUI package (v.1.5.1, REF) in R (v.4.0.2; R Development Core Team). Convergence of Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was determined using the Rhat statistic and visual inspection of trace plots (Gelman et al. YR). Models were compared using LOOIC (Vehtari et al. 2017) and Goodness-of-fit was determined using the Pareto-K statitsic (Vehtari et al. 2017). I first eliminated models that did not converge using the Rhat statistic, then used LOOIC and Pareto-K statistic to select the best model. Joint posterior distributions of estimated parameters from the best model, then, were used to estimate the unobserved number of deaths and their 95% credible intervals.

## Results

### Heat-related deaths

```{r heat_output, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

LOOIC.DIC.Heat.df <- readRDS("RData/LOOIC_DIC_Heat_2020-07-04.rds")

best.model.heat.ID <- unlist(strsplit(LOOIC.DIC.Heat.df[1,"model"], "M"))[2]

RhatTooBig.heat <- which(LOOIC.DIC.Heat.df$max.Rhat >= 1.1)

LOOIC.DIC.Heat.df %>% filter(max.Rhat < 1.1) %>%
  arrange(by = LOOIC) -> LOOIC.DIC.Heat.conv.df

best.model.heat.conv.ID <- unlist(strsplit(LOOIC.DIC.Heat.conv.df[1, "model"], "M"))[2]
best.model.heat.conv <- model.names[as.numeric(best.model.heat.conv.ID)]
```

MCMC convergence did not reach for ```r length(RhatTooBig.heat)``` models (Appendix). These models are not considered further. For those models with acceptable convergence (Rhat < 1.1). The best model was ```r best.model.heat.conv```, which included time-independent S (i.e., s1 = -S), K, time-independent P, and the Poisson distribution as the observation model (i.e., the mean and variance of observations are equal over time). The second best model also was a Poisson-observation model with time-dependent S parameter (Table 1). The Pareto-k statistics indicated 99.8% of data points were < 0.7, indicating an excellent fit of the model to the data (Appendix). The best (```r best.model.heat.conv```) model was used to estimate the number of total heat-related deaths.

```{r LOOIC_DIC_heat_conv, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
knitr::kable(LOOIC.DIC.Heat.conv.df %>% select(model.names, LOOIC, SE, max.Rhat), 
             col.names = c("Model", "LOOIC", "SE", "Maximum Rhat"),
             digits = 2,
             caption = "Table 1. LOOIC, their SE, and Rhat statistics for models fit to the heat-related deaths of green turtles at Raine Island and showed MCMC convergence for all parameters.",
             table.attr = "style='width:30%;'")
```

```{r heat_best_model, echo=F, cache=T, include=F}
best.model.heat <- readRDS(paste0("RData/Richards_Heat_", 
                                  model.names[as.numeric(best.model.heat.conv.ID)],
                                  ".rds"))
stats.P <- best.model.heat$summary %>% as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "Parameter") %>%
  filter(Parameter == "P")
```

The mean peak of heat-related deaths occurred at ```r signif(stats.P$mean, digits = 3)``` (SE = ```r signif(stats.P$sd, digits = 1)```), which corresponded to the middle of June (95% CI ranged from ```r signif(stats.P$'2.5%', digit = 3)``` to ```r signif(stats.P$'97.5%', digit = 3)```). There was a significant variability in the height of the peak among seasons (Figure 2).

```{r Heat_best_results, echo=F, cache=T, include=F}

X_Heat <-
  compute.summary.stats_S_K_P(samples = best.model.heat$samples, 
                              seasons = seasons, 
                              total.days = max.days$total.days)

p.heat <- ggplot() + 
  geom_path(data = X_Heat$X.df,
            aes(x = DOS, y = Med)) +
  geom_ribbon(data = X_Heat$X.df,
              aes(x = DOS, ymin = Low, ymax = High),
              alpha = 0.4) +

                           Sys.Date(), ".png"), 
         plot = p.heat, device = "png",
         dpi = 600, width = 5.8, height = 5.8)

```


```{r plot_heat, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, fig.cap = "Figure 2. Season-specific fitted functions and their 95% CIs for heat-related deaths at Raine Island. Dots indicate the observed deaths."}

```

To determine the total number of heat-related deaths, I added estimated deaths for each season. The total abundance weas computed using the estimated total abundance from mark-resight estimation. There appeared to be two relationships between the abundance and heat-related deaths, where one had a greater slope than the other (Figure 3).

           total.med = unlist(lapply(X_Heat$X.season.sums, FUN = quantile, 0.50)),
           total.high = unlist(lapply(X_Heat$X.season.sums, FUN = quantile,0.975))) %>%

### Cliff-fall deaths

```

MCMC convergence did not reach for ```r length(RhatTooBig.cliff)``` models (Appendix). These models are not considered further. For those models with acceptable convergence (Rhat < 1.1). The best model was ```r best.model.cliff.conv```, which included time-dependent S, K, time-dependent observation variance (sigmaYt) and the normal distribution as the observation model. The second best model also was a Normal-observation model with time-dependent S and sigmaY parameters (Table 3). The Pareto-k statistic indicated that 99% of data points were < 0.7, indicating an excellent fit of the model. The best (```r best.model.cliff.conv```) model was used to estimate the number of total heat-related deaths.

In the best model, the peak of the cliff-fall deaths was assumed to be the half-way in to the season. The second best model (```r second.best.model.cliff.conv```) included P as the estimated parameter and its mean was ```r signif(stats.P$mean, digits = 3)``` and 95% CI from ```r signif(stats.P$'2.5%', digits = 3)```  to ```r signif(stats.P$'97.5%', 3)```, indicating that it was not different from the half-way into the season (```r signif(mean(model.setting.list$jags.data.cliff$P), digits = 3)```).

There appeared to be two relationships between the abundance and cliff-fall deaths, as they were found in the heat-reldated datehs, where one had a greater slope than the other (Figures 3 and 6).
